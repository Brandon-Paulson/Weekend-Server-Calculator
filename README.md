## Weekend Server Calculator
## Description
Duration: 2 Week Sprint

The problem solved by this project was to create a calculator that took in two parameters along with an operator and appending the solution value to the DOM. To do this I used express fetch, post, and get requests to move data between the client and server side. Additionally, I added in a delete button which cleared the DOM.

## Prerequisites

Node.js
Express


## Installation
The first step for this app to run would be to init npm along with installation of Express. This app requires a basic server and static file pathway to be setup and then a few routes to be established using express get requests. 

To start the server run npm start and feel free to run some caluclations!

## Usage
To use the application type in your value and operator once you are ready to run the calculation hit the '=' button and the solution shall appear on the webpage!
